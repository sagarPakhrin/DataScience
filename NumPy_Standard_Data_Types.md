# NumPy Standard Data Types
Numpy arrays contain values of a single type, so it is important to have detailed knowledge of those
types and their limitations. Because NumPy is Built in C, the types will be familiar to users of C,
			Fortan, and other related languages.

** Table 2-1 show data types with their description **

| Data type | Description  |
| :---------- | :---------------- |
| bool_  | Boolean( True of False ) stored as a byte |
